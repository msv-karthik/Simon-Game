## About

Simon Game is a simple JavaScript-based game where the player has to repeat a randomly generated sequence of colors by clicking the respective buttons. The game continues with increasing levels of difficulty until the player fails to repeat the sequence correctly. This project was created as an exercise to learn about event handling, DOM manipulation, and CSS animations.

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. The game will display a sequence of colored buttons.
3. After the sequence is shown, you must click the colored buttons in the same order as displayed.
4. The game gets harder with each correct sequence as the length of the sequence increases.
5. If you make a mistake, the game will end and display your score.
6. Press any key to restart the game.
